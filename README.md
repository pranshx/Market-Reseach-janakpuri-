Project Summary: Subscription Model for Organic Products & Fresh Juices
This project explores consumer preferences for a subscription model delivering organic products and fresh juices in the Janakpuri area. The research focuses on understanding daily and weekly purchase habits, willingness to switch to organic alternatives, and preferred delivery frequency. Data was gathered through an online survey, with 110 responses collected.

Key findings indicate a split in willingness to pay a premium for organic products, with some consumers open to a 10-15% price increase, while others are more price-sensitive. The project recommends targeting premium consumers and convincing price-conscious individuals by emphasizing the health benefits of organic products and providing affordable options.
